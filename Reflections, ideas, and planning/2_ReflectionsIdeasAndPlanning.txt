Reflections, ideas, and planning
September 16, 2020

1- I'm interested in creating an AI Personal Assistant that can help people with their daily tasks. Like replying to messages, writing emails, scheduling meetings, etc.

2- I think the best way is to have some parts of the app to be free and more advanced ones that could
improve the experience to be paid. Many applications do that and it works. After you become a power user
in the app, you may need more access and decides to pay.

3- Wayfair is one of my favorite apps for shopping. It has a better UX than its competitors like Amazon and Overstock.
The design is very clean and clever. It's very easy to navigate through the categories and the product page is very intuitive,
you have access to all the information you need. The reviews section is very meaningful and helpful. It requires
less scroll than many other apps. They are also constantly updating the app. They are also a top #4 app in the Benchmark E-commerce
UX case studies.

4- I think the class discussions have made me realize that we have a lot of apps out there that have original ideas,
but terrible implementation. I also think that apps that have some type of AI are more useful, which is leading
me to the right path to make a final project decision.
